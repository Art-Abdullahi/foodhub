I have to say, it was simply perfect! The food was very nicely presented, very fresh and extremely tasty. The one thing that made the evening perfect was our waiter. Funny, attentative, relaxed and very knowledgeable - this was the cherry on the cake. In addition, no frills when you pick up the bill, the value for money is great.
